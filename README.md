üöÄ Nightwatch v3
What's New | Release Notes | Discussions

Nightwatch v3 is an all new generation that has been built around these three pillars:

Developer Experience : The entire experience from getting started, to writing and debugging tests, has been redesigned for speed, stability, and consistent non-flaky results.

Mobile first: Test your web or native, iOS and Android, mobile applications on simulators, real mobile devices or a cloud grid like BrowserStack.

One test automation framework: Run all types of tests from unit, component, and E2E to API, visual, and accessibility with a single framework.

The Nightwatch v3 is not just a new version, it‚Äôs the result of months of engineering effort to reimagine test automation for the future. Try it out in 60 seconds and see it in action.

‚öôÔ∏è Get started in 60 seconds
1. Install Nightwatch from NPM
From your existing project's root dir:

npm init nightwatch@latest
or, if you want to initialize a new project:

npm init nightwatch@latest ./path/to/new/project
nightwatch-cli-gif

2. Answer a few questions about your preferred setup:
What is your Language - Test Runner setup?
Where do you want to run your e2e tests?
Where you'll be testing on?
Where do you plan to keep your end-to-end tests?
What is the base_url of your project?
Nightwatch will do the entire setup for you based on your answers.

3. Run a Demo Test:
Nightwatch comes with a few examples, which are automatically copied to your Nightwatch project during the setup and can also be used as boilerplate to write your own tests on top of them.

You can follow the instructions given at the end of the setup to run your first test with Nightwatch.
